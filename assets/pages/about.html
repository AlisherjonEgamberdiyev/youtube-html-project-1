      In 2004, the first Hotel HRM property opened its doors across from the
      Fabulous Fox Theatre in the eclectic arts and entertainment district of
      Midtown Atlanta. Today, we call culturally rich communities all over the
      world home, from New York to Paris, London to Shanghai, Hong Kong to
      Singapore—all the places you’ve always wanted to visit and do business in.
      Our team members go out of their way to make each stay memorable and our
      neighborhoods easy to discover and appreciate. From must-see, hear and eat
      experiences to those hidden gems off the beaten path, you can trust our
      team members to provide you with great local recommendations. Our
      properties feature unique design at every turn without compromising guest
      comfort. A vibrant modern color palette, complemented by natural light and
      locally influenced design and decor, make for an inviting, stylish and
      refreshing atmosphere.
